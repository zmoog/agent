# zmoog labs announces Agent to enable users to automate daily activities

Agent automates tedious daily activities like collecting and ordering information you need to focus on in the different areas of your life.

VEROLENGO–July 31, 2023 - zmoog labs, a Verolengo company, today launched a new personal assistant for Telegram that notifies users when the information and activities they want or need to do become available during the day.


[Problem]

In modern daily life we need to keep track of a lot of information: cancel the TV sports subscription when the season ends, check the kid's school grades, and tomorrow's homework.

Standard approaches like reminders and todo lists can grow and grow, and you feel anxious every time you open them.

You are on your own to reviewing all the things in the air, gather the information, and decide to what act upon.


[Solution]

Whouldn't be nice if someone—or something—can sort all this crap for you and only surface the relevant portion at the right time?
