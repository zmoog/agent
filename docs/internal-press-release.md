# zmoog labs announces Agent to enable users to automate daily activities

Agent automates tedious daily activities like collecting and ordering things you need to focus on in the different areas of your life.

[Verolengo, Turin–July 2023 – Agent is your personal assistant that can gather, order, and summarize di information for you. Save time handing-off the grinding to a helpful assistant and just fine-tune the information and act upon them.

[Problem]

In modern daily life we need to keep track of a lot of information: buy the kids' school books, cancel the TV sports subscription in three months, check kids' school grades and and tomorrow's homework.

Standard approaches like todo lists can grow and grow, and you feel anxious every time you open them.

[Solution]

Whouldn't be nice if someone—or something—can sort all this crap for you and only surface the relevant portion at the right time?

Agent will collect and prepare the information for you.
